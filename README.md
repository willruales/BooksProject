1.Why are we doing this?

This is a microservice project that demonstrates what I have learnt over the past 10 weeks. Spring Boot, Maven, CRUD, SQL, JUNIT testing, Git has been used to follow full fill the marking schemes expectations.

2.How I expected the challenge to go

I thought it would be harder in some areas. I knew things would go well so long as I managed my time correctly and I went at my own pace.

3.What went well? / What didn't go as planned? 

Crud Functionality worked. Postman Tests worked fine.
I was unable to get my Update Mockito Test to work and I couldn't get my web tests to work either.

4.Possible improvements for future revisions of the project 
Add another integrated DB and do more testing.
