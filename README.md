# BooksProject

1.Why are we doing this?

This is a microservice project that demonstrates what I have learnt over the past 10 weeks. Spring Boot, Maven, CRUD, SQL, JUNIT testing, Git has been used to follow fullfill the marking schemes expectations.


2.How I expected the challenge to go

I thought it would be harder in some areas.
I knew things would go well so long as I managed my time correctly and I went at my own pace.
